/*******************************************************************************
 * _components.scss
 *
 * Imports more partials that contain full components (modules in SMACSS), their
 * sub-components and modifiers.
 *
 * Components are discrete parts of your page that should sit within the regions
 * of your layouts. You should try to abstract your components as much as
 * possible to promote reuse throughout the theme. Components should be flexible
 * enough to respond to any width and should never rely on context
 * (e.g. .sidebar-first .component) for styling. This allows modules to be
 * placed throughout the theme with no risk of them breaking.
 *
 * If you find you need to change the look of a component depending on it's
 * context you should avoid using context based classes at all costs. Instead it
 * is better to add another "modifier" class to the component to alter the
 * styling. Again, this promotes reuse.
 *
 * Sub-components are the individual parts that make up a component. As a
 * general rule, adding a class to target a sub-component is a much better
 * option than using descendant selectors or element selectors. In many cases
 * sub-components can be made more reusable by making them components in their
 * own right, so they can then be used within other components.
 *
 * Almost everything that doesn't belong in base should be made a component.
 * Here's some common examples throughout Drupal:
 *
 * - Blocks
 * - Content Types - For example, you may have a generic node component that
 *      contains sub-components for the submitted by line and links. Specific
 *      components can then be created for each content type to style the
 *      specifics of each. Finally, by using entity view modes you can easily
 *      apply modifications based on the .node-[view-mode] classes.
 * - Forms - For instance the log in form.
 * - Views - Each views output style could be made into a component, the content
 *       of each row should be provided my a view mode styled by it's component
 *       CSS. Exposed filter forms, views pagers and other views elements are
 *       also good candidates for components.
